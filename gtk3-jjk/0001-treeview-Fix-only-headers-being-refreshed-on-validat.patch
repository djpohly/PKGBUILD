Subject: [PATCH] treeview: Fix only headers being refreshed on validate

Since the introduction of the widget clip API, said clip is used instead
of allocation on queue_redraw()

But because this wasn't set during treeview's size_allocate() any
queue_redraw() called during the gtk_tree_view_size_allocate_columns()
would basically be no-op (as clip was reset to 0), and eventually lead
to only the headers be refreshed, not the content/view.
