Subject: [PATCH] cellarea: Fix possibly getting invalid inner_area

gtk_cell_area_inner_cell_area() could set an invalid inner_area if
cell_area was very small (e.g. width=1), as it could lead to a negative
width once the 2*focus_line_width was removed, which in turn would lead
to an assertion failing later on/the app aborting.
