Subject: [PATCH] GtkTreeView: Fix issues when removing a column

When removing a column from a treeview, _gtk_tree_view_column_unset_tree_view()
gets called. This would use gtk_container_remove() to remove the button (from
column header) from the treeview.

In addition to a memory leak (the button never being unreferenced), this would
cause quite a few issues in the treeview, where wrong window/button would be
used on remaining columns, going from visual/UI glitches to segfaults.

This is because the button wasn't added to the treeview via GtkContainer, the
treeview was set as parent of the button (via gtk_widget_set_parent() from
gtk_tree_view_column_create_button()). Therefore, the proper way to "undo" this
is call gtk_widget_unparent() on the button.
