Subject: [PATCH 1/3] GRWLock: Tweak doc to make things a bit clearer

The doc used different phrasing for the same thing, e.g. "if any thread"
vs "any another thread."

Also make it clear that trying to take a write lock while already having
a lock, or trying to take a read lock while having a write lock, is
undefined.
